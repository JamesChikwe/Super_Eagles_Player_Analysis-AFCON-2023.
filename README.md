### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

2. Data cleaning.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the Super Eagles AFCON data to answer key question, such as:
- What is the total number of matches played?
- What is the total number of goals scored?
- What is the total number of goals conceded?
- What is the average age of the players in the Super Eagles?
- What is the total number of interceptions per player?
- What is the total number of fouls per player?
- What is the total number of tackles won per player?
- What is the total number of shots on target per player?
- What is the total number of combined goals and assist per player?
- What is the total number of combined goals saved and conceded by the goalkeeper?

 ### Data Analysis

 After we downloaded the data, we cleaned the data by removing the unwanted rows in the sheets and we used PowerBI to create our dashboard to show all our findings.

 ### Results:
 The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 1. The total number of matches played by the Super Eagles in the AFCON 2023 is 7.
 2. The total number of  goals scored by the Super Eagles in the AFCON 2023 is 7.
 3. The total number of goals conceded by the goalkeeper in the AFCON is 4.
 4. The average age of the players in the Super Eagles is 26.6.
 5. Frank Onyeka has the highest number of interceptions in the Super Eagles team throughout the AFCON tournament.
 6. "Ademola Lookman committed the highest number of fouls in the Super Eagles team throughout the AFCON tournament.
 7. Victor Osimhen has the highest number of shots on target in the Super Eagles team throughout the AFCON tournament.
 8. Ademola Lookman has the highest number of combined goals and assist in the Super Eagles team throughout the AFCON tournament.
 9. The goalkeeper has conceded goals at a rate of 17.39%, while saving shots at a rate of 82.61%.

### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
#### Goalkeeper Improvement:
 - The goalkeeper did well, but can work on letting in fewer goals. They should practice more to get better at stopping shots and being in the right place at the right time.
 #### Better Defense:
  - We saw Frank Onyeka doing a good job at stopping the other team. We can all work together to stop the other team from scoring.
#### Be Smarter on the Field:
 - Ademola Lookman got into trouble a lot. We should learn to play better without fouling so much. Let's be smarter about where we are on the field.
#### Score More Goals:
 - Victor Osimhen did a great job at shooting. Let's make sure we're setting him up to score even more goals in the future.
#### Help Our Young Players Grow:
 - We have a young team. Let's make sure we help them get even better at soccer. We can also look for new, young players to join the team.
#### Use Numbers to Make Better Choices:
 - Keep track of how we play and what works best. This way, we can make smarter choices about how we play in the future.

### Limitations:

I had to remove the row that contains Stanley Nwabili, Francis Uzoho, and Olorunleke Ojo from the first sheet because they are not players. On the second sheet, I had to remove the rows that contain the goalkeepers from South Africa, Ivory Coast, and Congo DR, leaving only the goalkeeper from Nigeria on the sheet.
